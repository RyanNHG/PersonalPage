        After my sophomore year in high school, I had the opportunity to become an intern at a local small business called Heartland Business Systems. There I began completing task using SQL, Microsoft CRM, Microsoft SharePoint, and got my first lesson in C# and ASP.NET Web Forms.

        I first met Truepad at a startup career fair at the University of Illinois. A few months later, I began my internship at their office in Chicago. They were in need of a Frontend Engineer, and within the first few days I was coding and designing components on our website. From fixing CSS style bugs to connecting to MySQL databases through Wordpress, the team at Truepad gave me an incredible look at what it takes to work with deadlines and how all the pieces fit together.
