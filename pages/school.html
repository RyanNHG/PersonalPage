      <strong>Data Structures</strong> was one of the most critical classes in my programming curriculum. I had a fantastic professor, Cinda Heeren, who taught our class the importance of intelligent code design and several types of data structures. This class taught me how clean, efficient code can save time and frustration across all programming languages.

      I was very excited to take <strong>Computer Architechure</strong> in my sophomore year in college. I always wanted to have a better understanding of operating systems, and how they are designed and programmed in the modern world. In this class, I was able to make a Linux operating system with a team of talented students.

      In <strong>Database Systems</strong>, I created my first website. Using Foundation and jQuery, I took my first steps in writing code that looks awesome across different screens and devices. With a team of engineering students, <em>Monotony</em> was created. Our site allowed for users to find students in their classes, with Python and SQL Database running in the background. This class inspired me to become a Frontend Engineer and Mobile Web Design Geek.

      <strong>User Interface Design</strong> was a combination of a Computer Science and a Psychology class. This class introduced me to principles of clean and simple design, how to think like a user, and how to evalute the quality of a design using feedback and other metrics. Working in a group, I created a demo of <a href="http://nowplaying.web.engr.illinois.edu">NowPlaying</a>, a site that allowed users to create and listen to playlists together.
